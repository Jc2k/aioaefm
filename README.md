# aioeafm

This is a thin wrapper for the [Real Time flood monitoring API](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference).

This wrapper is built for home-assistant. We target the same python versions as home-assistant and follow similar code style guidelines.

```bash
pip install aioeafm
```
